#. TRANS: The format used when writing the time in full
#. letters.  You must take care to use a font size large enough
#. so that kids can read it easily, but also small enough so
#. that all times combination fit on the screen, even when the
#. screen is rotated.  Pango markup:

#. TRANS: The format used to display the weekday and date
#. (example: Tuesday 10/21/2008) We recommend to use the same
#. font size as for the time display.  See
#. http://docs.python.org/lib/module-time.html for available

#. TRANS: The format used to display the time for digital clock
#. You can add AM/PM indicator or use 12/24 format, for example
#. "%I:%M:%S %p".  See
#. http://docs.python.org/lib/module-time.html for available
#. strftime formats If the display of the time is moving
#. horizontally, it means that the glyphs of the digits used in
#. the font don't have the same width. Try to use a Monospace

#. TRANS: The rules to print the time in the localized language.
#.
#. Example syntax:
#. time(h, 15) => a quarter to hour(h) am_pm(h) |
#. The left hand side of the rule defines a pattern with a variable 'h' and a
#. value '15'.
#. The right hand side, when applied, will use the text "a quarter to " and call
#. the first rule matching hour(h) after substituting the variable 'h' by its value,
#. and call the rule matching am_pm(h).
#. Internal spaces are significant on the right side of a rule. In calls, all
#. arguments which are not numbers are considered to be variables. The rule parser
#. is very simple and will let many syntax errors go ignored.
#.
#. A rule ends with the character '|'.
#. The character '_' is a anonymous variable.
#. The character '#' can be used to concatenate two text fragments. For instance:
#. plural(1) => |
#. plural(_) => s |
#. hour(h) => number(h) hour#plural(h) |
#. Use '\#' to use a # character, for instance in a pango color
#. tag like <span foreground="\#FF0055">
#.
#. You can put range conditions on firing a rule, with the syntax [var1 < var2] or
#. [var1 < var2 < var3]. For instance:
#. hours(h) [h < 12] => in the morning |
#. hours(h) [12 < h < 18] => in the afternoon |
#. hours(_) => in the night |
#.
#. These rules will be called with the root pattern "time(hour, minute)", with the
#. variable 'hour' bound to the current hour and the variable 'minute' to the
#. current minute.
#. Order of rules is important. Rules are tried from first to last. So most precise
#. rule must be placed first in the list.
#.
#. You can validate your set of rules by running the command line:
#. python timewriter.py LANG
#.
#. You should use pango markup to respect the same colors as for the clock hands.
#. Look at the README file from the activity for explanations on how to create
#. rules.
